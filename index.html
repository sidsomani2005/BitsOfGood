                <p>I'm studying Computer Science and Mathematics at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech). I was born in India, grew up in Hong Kong, and boarded at a golf academy throughout high school training to become a D1 golfer. Along the way, I was magnetized by the ever-changing world of technology, and chose to pursue a degree in Computer Science. I am an avid software developer and intend to utilize the skills learning within the halls of Georgia Tech to effectively propel my goals towards social good. </p>
